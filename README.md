# DigiKala App

A fully-featured **e-commerce Android application** inspired by DigiKala, offering a **multi-theme** and **multi-language** experience. This app is built with **MVVM architecture**, adheres to **SOLID principles**, and leverages **Kotlin Coroutines** and **Flow** for reactive programming. Dependency injection is implemented using **Hilt** and **Dagger**. The app incorporates modern design patterns such as **Single Activity Architecture** and **Singleton** for efficient and scalable development. Persistent data storage is managed with **DataStore**. Animations are enhanced using **Lottie** for smooth and engaging user interactions.
